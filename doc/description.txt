II. INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

First line just gives some idea of what the calculation is going to produce. 
Further on all input parameters are explained. Probably the best way to find out the one
you need is to do search by its name.

iter_dft - number of LDA iterations.

iter_hf - number of Hartree-Fock iterations.

iter_gw - number of GW iterations.

iter_qp - number of Quasiparticle GW iterations.

admix - mixing for LDA iterations (charge).

adspin - mixing for LDA iterations (spin).

adm_gw - initial mixing for HF, QP, GW, or GWG iterations. In all these cases self energy
is mixed.

acc_it_gw - final mixing for HF, QP, GW, or GWG iterations. Mixing is changed linearly
from iteration to iteration from its initial value to its final.

iexch - specifies the LDA parametrization for exchange-correlation energy. For details
se the file exchcorr.f. Only LDA works presently (not GGA).

nproc_tau - number of processors for (tau,omega)-parallelization. There
are certain requirements. The following numbers: (n_tau/2+1)/nproc_tau,
(n_omega_exa+n_omega_asy+1)/nproc_tau, and (n_nu_exa+n_nu_asy+1)/nproc_tau
should all be integer. About the variables (n_tau, n_omega_exa, n_omega_asy,
n_nu_exa,n_nu_asy) see below.

nproc_k - number of processors for k-parallelization. Should divide exactly the number
of irreducible points in Brillouin zone.

irel - takes care of the relativistic effects:
 = 0: nonrelativistic calculation;
 = 1: scalar-relativistic calculation;
 = 2: fully relativistic calculation.

clight - light velocity in a.u. Can be changed if one is interested in the effect or for the
debugging purposes.

rel_interst - if =T and irel=2, then interstitial region is described fully relativistically
(available only for LDA runs). In other situations spin-orbit effect is neglected in interstitial.

irel_core - similar to the parameter irel but for core electrons only. Works for pure
LDA runs only. In other cases should be set equal to irel.

temperature - temperature in K.

allfile - defines where the output goes. Different parts of the code just add their own
specifications when perform the output, so a lot of files is formed. The description of output
files is going to be written separately.

symgen - generator of the symmetry group. Gives the minimal set of operations which
(after all mutual multiplications) produces full set of symmetry operations. In the specific
example above: I means spatial inversion, R4Z - four rotations around Z-axis; R3D - three
rotations around (111)-axis (main diagonal of the cube for cubic solids).

par - lattice parameter (Bohr radiuses).

natom - number of atoms in the unit cell.

nsort - number of inequivalent atoms.

istruc - It is used mostly to specify the k-points of high symmetry. See
k_for_band_plot.f. The conventions are the following:
 =1 for simple cubic;
 =2 for body-centered cubic;
 =3 for face-centered cubic;
 =4 for hexagonal;
 =5 for simple tetragonal;
 =6 for body-centered tetragonal;
 =7 for simple orthorhombic;
 =8 for body-centered orthorhombic;
 =9 for face-centered orthorhombic;
 =10 for simple monoclinic.

is - specifies the correspondence between full list of atoms and the list of inequivalent
atoms. For example for BaFe2As2 we have 5 atoms in full list (Ba, Fe, Fe, As, As) and
3 in the list of inequivalent atoms (Ba, Fe, As). So the record in this case should be
is= 1 2 2 3 3.

b_a - first orthorhombic factor. Scales b-direction.

c_a - second orthorhombic factor. Scales c-direction.

a= -0.500000000000 0.500000000000 0.500000000000
b= 0.500000000000 -0.500000000000 0.500000000000
c= 0.500000000000 0.500000000000 -0.500000000000
The above three lines specify vectors of primitive translations measured in lattice param-
eter units. Orthorhombic scalings can be given here immediately or specified in b/a;c/a
variables.

tau - gives the atom coordinates in lattice parameter units. Should be repeated for all
atoms in the unit cell. The same convention about orthorhombic scalings is applied as in
the case of lattice translations.

mdiv - defines the r-mesh in the unit cell (three numbers correspond to the number of
divisions along three translation vectors on which the unit cell is built). This mesh is used in
electronic density, Hartree potential, and LDA exchange-correlation potential evaluations.

nrdiv - defines the r-mesh in the unit cell which is used in polarizability and self energy
calculations.

cut_lapw_ratio - defines the maximal value of k+G for LAPW basis in the interstitial
region as cut_lapw_ratio*A, where A— maximal Radius of G-sphere associated with nrdiv.

cut_pb_ratio - defines the maximal value of k + G for product basis in the interstitial
region as cut_pb_ratio*A, where A— maximal Radius of G-sphere associated with nrdiv.

eps_pb - optimization parameter in constructing the product basis inside MT spheres.
Usual choice is 10^(-2)- 10^(-3).

nbndf - defines the number of bands to be used in Green's function representation. If
nbndf=0 then all bands available are used (in this case their number is equal to the number
of LAPW+LO basis functions).

emindos - the lowest energy for DOS plotting (relative to chemical potential, in Ry).

emaxdos - the highest energy for DOS plotting (relative to chemical potential, in Ry).

ndos - number of points for DOS plotting (equidistant mesh).

n_cont_frac - defines the number of lowest positive Matsubara frequencies when fitting
the continued-fractions approximation for analytical continuation.
e_small - small positive shift when calculating retarded fermionic functions on real
axis.(Ry)

ndiv - three numbers which define the k-mesh in Brillouin zone.

metal - when (metal=T) the inverse uniform dielectric constant is enforced to be exactly
zero. If (metal=F) there is no such enforcement, which is appropriate for nonmetals. Not
particularly important but improves stability when the number of k-points is small.

n_k_div - number of divisions along every line, which connects two k-points of high
symmetry. For bands plotting only. The option relevant only for LDA.

k_line - three numbers defying the direction in reciprocal space for certain output pur-
poses.

vv0 - defines the relative volume (V/V0). V0 is given by crystal structure and lattice
parameter above.

b_extval - Absolute value of external magnetic field (Ry/mB).

iter_h_ext - five digits placed together. They are used for initial spin polarization
together with variable magn_shift (see below about the atomâ€™s description). First digit
means how many LDA iterations are to be performed with applied field as specified by
magn_shift for every atom in unit cell. Correspondingly the rest of the digits mean the
same for HF, GW, or QP runs. One can start with non-spin-polarized LDA calculation but
then switch on the polarization at, for instance, GW level (iter_h_ext=00200 if we want
to start with two GW iteration with applied field).

b_ext - three numbers, defying the direction of constant external magnetic field, associ-
ated with variable b_extval.

n_tau - number of points on TAU-mesh (inhomogeneous).

n_tau_int - number of intervals on TAU-mesh to be used in TAU-Frequency transforms.
Not very critical. 1000 is good for many purposes.

n_omega_exa - number of fermionic frequencies on the dense part of the mesh.

n_omega_asy - number of fermionic frequencies on the part of the mesh where we use
Chebyshev polynomials (intermediate region).
omega_max - max fermionic frequency (Ry), beyond which we apply asymptotic expan-
sion.

interp_omega_d - number of Matsubara frequencies to be used to find the function at
Chebyshev point by interpolation in intermediate region.

n_nu_exa - number of bosonic frequencies on the dense part of the mesh.

n_nu_asy - number of bosonic frequencies on the part of the mesh where we use Chebyshev
polynomials.

nu_max - max bosonic frequency (Ry), beyond which we apply asymptotic expansion.

interp_nu_d - number of Matsubara frequencies to be used to find the function at Cheby-
shev point by interpolation in intermediate region.

Now we input the information for every inequivalent atom in the unit cell.

txtel - this is just symbolic representation of the atom.

z - nuclear charge.

magn_shift - external magnetic field (Ry/?B) for initial spin splitting. Associated with
the variable iter_h_ext.

smt - MT radius (Bohr radius).
h - defines radial mesh inside MT sphere r(i) = S*(e^(hi)-1)/(e^(hN)-1), i = 0,N, where S-MT radius, N-
number of points (N=nrad, see next input variable).

nrad - number of points on radial mesh.

z_dop - doping parameter.

lmb - maximal L for LAPW basis.

lmpb - maximal L for product basis.

lim_pb_mt - upper limits for the number of product basis functions for specific L from 0
to lmpb. Acts in compliance with eps_pb(see above).

ntle - number of different orbitals for every L from 0 to lmb. Orbitals differ by principal
quantum number.

Now for every L and principal quantum number we input the parameters
l, augm, atocc, ptnl, corr, idmd.

l - angular momentum;

augm - if (=LOC) than this orbital is local orbital. If (=APW) than it is constructed in
accord with standard LAPW procedure.

atocc - initial occupancy of the orbital.

ptnl - potential parameter. P = N + 1/2 - arctan(D)/Pi, where N is the principal
quantum number of the orbital, and D is the logarithmic derivative.

corr - specifies whether the orbital is included in correlated set (=L) or not included
(=N).

idmd - defines the way we solve the radial equations:
 IDMD = 0 - for the given energy (center of the band);
 IDMD = 1 - for the given potential parameter ptnl (see above);
 IDMD = 2 - Phi(Smt)=0; Phi(Smt)/=0 - bound sol-n, but not deriv;
 IDMD = 3 - Phi(Smt)=Phi(Smt)=0 - totally bound sol-n (for deep E);
 IDMD = 4 - for the given energy (equal to the Chemical Potential).

III. DESCRIPTION OF OUTPUT FILES
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


Besides standard output/error files which are created by the operational system and are
useful mostly when something unexpected has happened, there are many other files with
useful information. Below we provide the most important of them with brief description.
The names of all of them start with the symbols provided by user in the variable allfile
(see input file description). The rest of the name gives some hint of what is inside in most
cases.

allfile.out provides the progression of the calculation. It gives also the time consumed
by most relevant subroutines.


allfile_dft.dos provides the spectral function (SF) in LDA approximation. First col-
umn in the file is real frequency (eV) measured from chemical potential, second is spin-down
SF, third is spin-up SF, and the fourth is the full SF.

allfile_qp.dos provides the spectral function (SF) in QP approximation. First column
in the file is real frequency (eV) measured from chemical potential, second is spin-down SF,
third is spin-up SF, and the fourth is the full SF.

allfile_dn_qp.dosk provides the partial spectral function (PSF) in QP approximation
for the k-points of high symmetry (spin down). First column in the file is real frequency
(eV) measured from chemical potential.

allfile_up_qp.dosk provides the partial spectral function (PSF) in QP approximation
for the k-points of high symmetry (spin up). First column in the file is real frequency (eV)

approximation (atom ATOM). First column in the file is real frequency (eV) measured
from chemical potential, columns 2-5 correspond to spdf-states of spin-down, columns 6-9
correspond to spdf-states of spin-up. Different file is created for every symmetry-independent
sort of atom.

allfile_Im_sigc_w_band_k.qp provides the imaginary part of correlation self-energy as
a function of Matsubara's frequency in QP approximation for the k-points of high symmetry
(spin-down and spin-up). First column in the file is Matsubara's frequency (eV).

allfile_Re_sigc_w_band_k.qp provides the real part of correlation self-energy as a
function of Matsubara's frequency in QP approximation for the k-points of high symmetry
(spin-down and spin-up). First column in the file is Matsubara's frequency (eV).
